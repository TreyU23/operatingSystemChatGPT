# Live Desktop backend

The backend is a Java 21/Spring Boot 4.1 service that runs on `127.0.0.1:4317`. It owns profile-isolated OpenAI credentials, conversations, memories, approvals, iCloud CalDAV accounts, relevance-filtered dashboard context, Windows and Phone Link inspection, project lifecycle controls, and free local Windows media-session controls with Apple Music or Spotify session preference.

Use the complete setup, integration, security, API, test, and troubleshooting instructions in the [project README](../README.md).

For normal use, start the complete project from the repository root with one command:

```powershell
.\start.cmd
```

For backend-only development:

```powershell
.\scripts\bootstrap-java.ps1
.\scripts\run-backend.ps1
```

Health check:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:4317/health
```

Backend state is stored under `data\`. The original profile keeps backward-compatible files directly under `data\`; additional profiles use `data\profiles\<profile-id>\`. iCloud passwords and profile OpenAI API keys are encrypted with Windows DPAPI for the current Windows user before they are written. The `X-Profile-Id` request header selects the profile, and a missing header selects `default`. Never commit `.env` or the contents of `data\`.
