# Design QA — Interactive Live Desktop controls

- Source visual truth: `C:\Users\treyu\Personal Code\operatingSystemChatGPT\artifacts\source-recording-home.png`
- Source recording: `C:\Users\treyu\Videos\Recording 2026-08-02 175510.mp4`
- Implementation screenshot: `C:\Users\treyu\Personal Code\operatingSystemChatGPT\artifacts\implementation-home-final.png`
- Combined comparison: `C:\Users\treyu\Personal Code\operatingSystemChatGPT\artifacts\design-comparison-interactive.png`
- Viewport: 1664 × 840 CSS px
- Source pixels: 1664 × 840 after cropping 84 px of browser toolbar from the 1664 × 924 recording frame
- Implementation pixels: 1664 × 840 at deviceScaleFactor 1
- Density normalization: both sides were scaled to 832 × 420 and placed side by side in the combined comparison
- State: home dashboard, true-black theme, live local services connected, Phone Link connected

**Full-view comparison evidence**

- The modular six-control strip, navigation, three-column PC panel, blue-outlined Phone Link panel, and floating assistant command bar retain the selected Live Desktop composition.
- The source includes Opera browser chrome and a left browser sidebar; those are external browser UI and were not treated as product mismatches.
- The new restart/shutdown buttons intentionally occupy the top-right control area without changing the navigation hierarchy.
- Phone Link content intentionally differs from the recording: hardcoded Android and notification rows were replaced with the linked iPhone, live battery/sync status, privacy-safe notification availability, and internal quick actions.

**Focused-region comparison evidence**

- Phone Link panel: the existing blue outline, phone image slot, device heading, status hierarchy, and 2 × 2 action grid were preserved. Live battery and sync tiles fit the same visual language.
- Header controls: restart and power buttons use the same near-black surface, blue hover treatment, border radius, and Feather icon family as the rest of the dashboard.
- Assistant bar: the first pass allowed it to fall below the viewport after Phone Link expanded. It is now fixed at the same bottom-centered position shown in the recording.

**Required fidelity surfaces**

- Fonts and typography: Segoe UI Variable/Segoe UI stack, weights, compact labels, truncation, and hierarchy remain consistent with the reference.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: dashboard grid, airy gutters, radii, dividers, control spacing, and persistent command-bar placement match the source direction. No P0/P1/P2 layout issue remains.
- Colors and tokens: true black background, near-black surfaces, cobalt controls, mint health state, amber approvals, and red shutdown state are consistent and accessible.
- Image quality and assets: supplied phone, avatar, album art, VS Code, Figma, and Apple Music assets remain sharp and correctly cropped. No placeholder or handcrafted replacement art was introduced.
- Copy and content: action labels now accurately distinguish in-dashboard behavior from explicit external Phone Link launching. Shutdown consequences are explained before confirmation.

**Interaction verification**

- Calendar previous/next/today controls change the visible day and empty state.
- Apple Music play/pause, previous, next, shuffle, mute, progress, and track state respond in-dashboard.
- Recent Activity rows expand in-dashboard; View all/Show more change the list state.
- Phone Link automatically refreshes every five seconds, manually refreshes, exposes details, copies the device name, and keeps external launch explicitly labeled.
- Restart was pressed in the dashboard and verified to stop and relaunch ports 4173 and 4317 with the saved API key and live Phone Link state restored.
- Shutdown confirmation was opened and cancelled safely, then confirmed in a separate run; both ports stopped and the offline state appeared. Both services were relaunched and verified online for handoff.
- Browser console/proxy errors occurred only during the intentional restart window while the backend port was unavailable; the final live state has no persistent console error.

**Comparison history**

1. P2 — The assistant command bar was below the fold after the Phone Link panel gained live data.
   - Fix: made the command bar and privacy note persistent bottom overlays and added content clearance.
   - Post-fix evidence: `implementation-home-final.png` and `design-comparison-interactive.png` show the command bar visible at the bottom of the home dashboard.
2. P0 — The first lifecycle restart failed after briefly recovering because PowerShell split script paths containing spaces.
   - Fix: lifecycle launches now use encoded PowerShell commands with resolved script paths.
   - Post-fix evidence: dashboard restart restored both listeners and live data; the later shutdown test stopped both listeners and manual relaunch restored both.

**Findings**

- No actionable P0, P1, or P2 issue remains.
- P3: true Windows system toggles still use the existing approval-to-Windows-settings safety path. The dashboard now stays in place when an approval is queued, but Windows Settings remains external by design.

**Implementation checklist**

- [x] Preserve true-black Live Desktop visual system.
- [x] Add one-click frontend/backend restart.
- [x] Add confirmed frontend/backend shutdown.
- [x] Replace hardcoded Phone Link data with live local metadata and refresh states.
- [x] Make core dashboard widgets visibly interactive.
- [x] Restore persistent assistant access.
- [x] Pass frontend build, Sites tests, backend tests, browser interaction checks, restart, and shutdown verification.

final result: passed
